To aid them in their journey, there is a random item generation that can have different rarity items. By choosing to accept the item, the player gains or loses stat points. ',

It is similar to the next project shown below ("Return of the King") in which it is a platformer; however, there was a heavier emphasis on making different enemies that behave in their own ways. One such enemy is a squid-like enemy that shoots squid bullets at you. Another is a taco-like enemy that deploys spikes indicated by yellow fissure marks on the ground that vibrate then send out a spike. The last enemy type is a bat that drops bombs that tick and explode after a certain time. A key mechanic in this game is that the player can reflect and break projectiles with a slash attack; the squid bullets are reflected and can kill enemies, the spikes can be destroyed, and the bombs can be launched upwards (after being slashed the bomb can then kill enemies near the explosion).

      'This was a group final project for the class CS-UY 4553-B Game Design. This game consists of 7 playable levels, each with increasing difficulty while having characters and environments themed after candy (as the name of the game suggests). The objective of the game is to beat all the enemies of the current level to advance to the next level. To beat an enemy, the player can manually punch enemies with varying health to beat the enemy; however the player can choose to block an enemy attack to stun the enemy and if the player punches the enemy then (this system is mimic our original idea of a fighting game where the players are rewarded for predicting an enemy\'s attack and blocking it thereby allowing them to "punish" the enemy for being predictable), they are rewarded with a special item that has different effects depending on the enemy you defeat. There are four different enemies: a peppermint enemy that is the standard enemy that punches you, an M&M that shoots projectiles at you, a lollipop that throws other lollipops at you, and a butterscotch enemy that acts like a "bull" that charges at you and is confused if it collides with a wall or another object. To aid the player, there are macarons scattered around the map that gives the player a shield. The player also can look at a mini-map that details where the macarons are on the map and how the enemies are moving and can also move the camera to free-roam the map and see their surroundings. ',
