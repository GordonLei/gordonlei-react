        "description": "Augmented Library is a project team dedicated to making tools and services for NYU's Dibner Library. The goal of the team is to make applications that can incorporate Augmented Reality in order to enhance the library experience. The two main projects that we are currently working on include are \"Interactive Flyers\" and \"Path-Finding\". The goal of the Interactive Flyers project is to create scannable images similar to QR codes (but looks visually more appealing or related to the university) that will act as a billboard flyer. By scanning the image, the user will be prompted with an AR experience explaining the details of the flyer. The goal of the Path-Finding team is to use the A* algorithmn as a basis to create a tool that can be used by students to navigate to specific places within the library",
