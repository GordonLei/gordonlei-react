        Hi! My name is Gordon Lei, a current undergraduate majoring in Computer Science 
        and minoring in Game Engineering (and potentially minoring in Cybersecurity) 
        at New York University Tandon School of Engineering. Currently, I am taking 
        courses named Introduction to Databases, Intro to Operating Systems, Software 
        Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence.

        My passion for computer science sprouted from a common middle-school student's 
        toolkit: a TI-84 graphing calculator. At the very start of the semester, our 
        teacher showed us the manual for the calculator, encouraging us to read it and 
        learn about how to write functions within the calculator. I quickly fell in love 
        with creating simple programs with the TI-84, such as ones that outputted the answer 
        to the quadratic equation and eventually a slightly more complex all-purpose tool to 
        help my friends and I play Yu-Gi-Oh (a popular trading card game my friends and I played 
        in middle school) to use during our school's overnight trip (imagine bringing a 
        calculator to camping!).

        This interest in programming found me later joining our middle school's new-founded 
        computer science club, granting me an opportunity to get a taste of web development, 
        eventually leading me to pursue a computer science track at Stuyvesant High School and 
        currently a future Bachelor of Science for computer science.
