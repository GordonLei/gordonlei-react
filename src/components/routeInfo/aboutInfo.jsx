        Hello, my name is Gordon Lei, a current graduate studnet pursuing a
        Masters of Science in Software Engineering at the Carnegie Mellon
        University Silicon Valley Campus. For me, my love for computer science
        began from an unconventional item but was essential for any student; a
        TI-84 graphing calculator. Since the first day of class, my professor
        discussed how important it was to understand how to use our tools
        efficiently and suggested to everyone to read the TI-84 manual and learn
        their basic language known as TI-Basic. From making small applets that
        were mainly games that interested me, my love for programming sprouted
        to something I hold dearly today which is a little strange to me when I
        think back on how much one item impacted my whole life. In the future, I
        hope to be a software developer or potentially working within the
        cyber-security field. If I'm not working on schoolwork or personal
        projects, I am probably pursuing my newfound passion for cooking or
        researching the latest news on mechanical keyboards.
